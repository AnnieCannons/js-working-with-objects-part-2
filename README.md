# Working with Objects

- Objects in JavaScript are a fundamental concept and are widely used for organizing and managing data in various scenarios, including representing users, products, configurations, and more. They are an essential part of the language and are central to many programming tasks in JavaScript.

- An object in JavaScript is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key (also known as a property) is a unique identifier that maps to a value. The value can be a data type (such as a number, string, boolean, etc.) or even another object or function. Additionally, objects in JavaScript are dynamic, which means you can add, modify, or delete properties and methods at runtime.
